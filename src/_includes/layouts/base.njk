It began with Thurmond's Dixiecrat campaign in 1948, accelerated when Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act in 1964, was exploited by Nixon's Southern Strategy in 1968, and solidified under Reagan in 1980. In 2005, RNC Chairman Ken Mehlman formally apologized for the Southern Strategy."

It was North vs South, not Republican vs Democrat. And those Southern Democrats who opposed civil rights? Their voters became Republicans over the following decades, which is exactly what the party switch describes."

He called it 'the greatest mistake I ever made,' voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and supported renewing the Voting Rights Act. The NAACP praised him at his death in 2010. More importantly, the party switch was about voters, not individual politicians. The white South moved from Democratic to Republican; that's the switch."
