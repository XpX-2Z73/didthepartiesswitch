      "options": ["A. 60-150", "B. 10-15", "C. 5-8", "D. 200-300"],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "On Easter Sunday 1873, white paramilitaries attacked Black militia defending the Grant Parish courthouse in Louisiana. After the Black defenders surrendered under a white flag, between 60 and 150 men were systematically pulled from the group and executed. The Supreme Court case that followed, United States v. Cruikshank (1876), ruled that the federal government could not prosecute the murderers, effectively legalizing white supremacist terrorism.",

      "options": ["A. Ku Klux Klan operating in South Carolina", "B. White League from Louisiana", "C. Red Shirts", "D. Knights of the White Camelia from the Deep South"],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Red Shirts were a white supremacist paramilitary group that operated openly in South Carolina during Reconstruction. On July 4, 1876—the nation's centennial—they surrounded Black militia in Hamburg, demanded their weapons, and after the militia surrendered, executed five men. The leader of the Red Shirts, Wade Hampton, was elected governor that year through violence and fraud. No one was ever prosecuted.",

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Opelousas Massacre began when white Democrats attacked a Republican newspaper editor and escalated into a weeks-long campaign of terror across St. Landry Parish. Between 200 and 300 Black people were murdered. The violence was so effective that not a single Republican vote was recorded in the parish in the November 1868 election—in a parish where Republicans had previously won by a large majority.",

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Over three days in May 1866, white mobs—including police officers and firemen—attacked the Black community in Memphis. They killed 46 Black people, raped at least 5 Black women, and destroyed every Black church and every Black school in the city.

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "On July 30, 1866, white mobs attacked the Louisiana Constitutional Convention, which was meeting to extend voting rights to Black men. Police joined the attack.

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Black sharecroppers in Phillips County, Arkansas gathered to organize the Progressive Farmers and Household Union to fight exploitation by white landowners. When white men fired into their meeting, the sharecroppers returned fire, killing one attacker. White mobs then rampaged through the county for days, killing between 100 and 800 Black people.

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Over 18 hours on May 31-June 1, 1921, white mobs—some deputized by police—destroyed 35 blocks of the wealthiest Black community in America. They killed between 100 and 300 Black residents, left 10,000 homeless, and caused $1.8 million in property damage ($32 million today). Airplanes dropped incendiary devices on Black homes. No white person was ever convicted. Many victims were buried in unmarked mass graves still being discovered today.",
      "quote": "I could see planes circling in mid-air. They grew in number and hummed, darted and dipped low. I could hear something like hail falling upon the top of my office building. Down East Archer, I saw the old Mid-Way hotel on fire, burning from its top.",

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Rosewood was a prosperous Black town of about 200 people. In January 1923, a white mob attacked after a white woman falsely claimed a Black man had assaulted her. Over several days, whites from surrounding areas murdered at least 6 Black residents (likely many more), burned every structure in town, and drove all survivors away permanently. Rosewood ceased to exist. Florida didn't acknowledge the massacre until 1994, when it paid $2.1 million to survivors.",

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In July 1917, white mobs attacked Black neighborhoods in East St. Louis, Illinois, killing between 40 and 200 Black residents and driving out approximately half of the city's 6,000 Black residents. Homes were set on fire, and Black people fleeing the flames were shot or beaten. The violence was triggered by white workers' resentment of Black workers hired during labor disputes. A Congressional investigation found police had participated in the violence.",

      "answer": "D",

      "options": ["A. 5-10%", "B. 15-20%", "C. 30-45%", "D. 1-3%"],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Convict leasing was slavery by another name. In Alabama's coal mines, the annual death rate for leased convicts reached 30-45%—meaning nearly half of all prisoners died every single year. Companies had no incentive to keep workers alive because new convicts were always available. The system was more deadly than antebellum slavery because slaveholders had capital invested in their slaves; lessees had none.",

      "options": ["A. U.S. Steel", "B. Standard Oil", "C. Ford Motor Company", "D. General Electric"],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "U.S. Steel, through its subsidiary Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (TCI), used convict labor in Alabama until 1928. J.P. Morgan acquired TCI in 1907, and the company continued leasing convicts for another two decades. These were among America's most powerful corporations, building their wealth on what was effectively slave labor decades after the 13th Amendment.",

License pork processing plants and ensure meat safety standards", "D. Criminalize minor offenses to arrest Black people for convict labor"],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "'Pig laws' were statutes that made minor offenses—like stealing a pig worth $1—into felonies punishable by years of hard labor. Combined with vagrancy laws that criminalized unemployment, these laws were explicitly designed to arrest Black men and feed them into the convict leasing system. A man could be sentenced to years in a coal mine for not having proof of employment.",

      "options": ["A. Employers charged for supplies, then had workers arrested for 'fraud' if they left", "B. Workers voluntarily chose to stay because wages and conditions were favorable", "C. The government required work permits that restricted movement between jobs", "D. Workers signed lifetime contracts that courts enforced as binding agreements"],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Peonage worked through debt manipulation. Employers charged inflated prices for food, tools, and housing, ensuring workers always owed money. Trying to leave while in debt was criminalized as 'fraud' or 'obtaining money under false pretenses.' Workers who fled were hunted down and returned. This system trapped hundreds of thousands of Black Southerners in conditions indistinguishable from slavery until World War II.",

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Alabama was the last state to abolish convict leasing, ending the practice in 1928—63 years after the 13th Amendment supposedly ended slavery. The system only ended because of changing economics and limited federal pressure, not moral awakening. By that point, tens of thousands of Black men had died in mines, turpentine camps, and plantations under conditions often worse than antebellum slavery.",

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Equal Justice Initiative documented more than 4,400 racial terror lynchings in the South between 1877 and 1950. This number is almost certainly an undercount, as many lynchings went unreported or were disguised as accidents or unknown causes of death.

Her newspaper office was destroyed and she was forced into exile under death threats", "C. She was elected to Congress as a representative from Illinois to serve multiple terms", "D. She was praised by Southern newspapers for her honest reporting on race relations"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "After Ida B. Wells began publishing her investigations proving that lynching victims were not rapists but economic competitors or men who had consensual relationships with white women, her newspaper office (the Memphis Free Speech) was destroyed by a white mob in 1892. She was warned that she would be lynched if she returned to Memphis. She lived the rest of her life in exile in the North, continuing to document lynching and fight for justice.",

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "After Sam Hose was tortured and burned alive before a crowd of 2,000, his body parts were cut up and distributed as souvenirs.

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Congress introduced anti-lynching legislation more than 200 times over more than a century. The first bill was introduced in 1900. The House passed bills in 1922, 1937, and 1940, but Southern senators filibustered them to death every time.

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Grandfather clauses exempted citizens from literacy tests and poll taxes if their ancestors had been eligible to vote before 1867 (before the 15th Amendment). Since no Black Americans could vote before the 15th Amendment, this meant all Black voters had to pass impossible tests while illiterate white voters were exempted.

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Poll taxes in former Confederate states were typically $1-2 per year, but they were cumulative. To vote at age 30, you might have to pay $20-30 in back taxes (equivalent to hundreds of dollars today) all at once, at the exact moment you tried to register. For sharecroppers who rarely saw cash, this was impossible. By 1964, only five states still had poll taxes—Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia—all former Confederate states. The 24th Amendment banned poll taxes in federal elections in 1964, and the Supreme Court banned them in state elections in 1966.",

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In the one-party Democratic South, whoever won the Democratic primary won the general election. Texas and other states declared the Democratic Party a 'private organization' that could exclude Black members from voting in its primary.

      "explanation": "In 1964, only 6.7% of eligible Black Mississippians were registered to vote—about 28,500 people out of 422,000 eligible. In some counties with majority Black populations, not a single Black person was registered. After the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965, Black registration increased to 59.8% by 1967.

      "explanation": "In Cruikshank, the Supreme Court overturned federal convictions for the Colfax Massacre, ruling that the 14th Amendment only protected against state action, not private violence.

At harvest, the landowner weighed the crop (often fraudulently), set the price (always low), deducted the debt (always high), and presented the sharecropper with the 'balance'—which almost always showed the farmer owed more than they earned. It was mathematically designed to create permanent debt, and leaving while in debt was criminalized as fraud.",

Designated them as protected historic districts for preservation purposes", "D. Required integration with neighboring white communities over time"],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the 1930s, the federal government's HOLC created 'residential security maps' that rated neighborhoods. Black neighborhoods were outlined in red and labeled 'hazardous'—hence 'redlining.' Banks used these maps to deny mortgages to Black families regardless of their income or creditworthiness.

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The GI Bill was administered locally, allowing Southern officials to systematically deny benefits to Black veterans. Banks refused to give VA-backed mortgages in Black neighborhoods. White colleges rejected Black applicants, and Black colleges lacked capacity. In Mississippi, only 2 of 3,229 VA home loans in 1947 went to Black veterans. The GI Bill created the white middle class; Black veterans were locked out of the same opportunity.",

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Because banks wouldn't give mortgages to Black families, speculators bought houses cheap, then sold them to Black families on 'contract'—at 2-3 times the price, with no equity building until the final payment.

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Less than 2% of FHA-insured loans went to Black families during the period when the federal government was subsidizing the creation of the white middle class through homeownership. In some years, it was less than 1%. This wasn't accidental—it was policy. The GI Bill's home loan benefits were similarly denied to Black veterans.

The Supreme Court upheld her forced sterilization, ruling states could sterilize those deemed 'unfit'", "C. She was released from custody without charges being filed against her", "D. Her case was dismissed on procedural grounds by the lower court"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Carrie Buck, a young woman committed to a Virginia institution after being raped by her foster family's nephew, was chosen as a test case for Virginia's eugenics law. The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that states could forcibly sterilize those deemed 'feeble-minded.' Later evidence showed Carrie and her daughter were of normal intelligence—the 'three generations of imbeciles' were simply poor women. Buck v. Bell has never been explicitly overturned.",

Because these were the jobs held predominantly by Black workers—Southern Democrats demanded their exclusion", "D. They were covered under existing state laws providing similar benefits"],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "When the New Deal created Social Security, unemployment insurance, and labor protections, Southern Democrats demanded that domestic workers and agricultural workers be excluded—because these were the jobs held by most Black workers in the South. This wasn't accidental; it was the price of Southern support. As a result, 65% of Black workers were excluded from the New Deal's most important protections.",

The first successful Black labor union, led by A. Philip Randolph, which won recognition after 12 years of organizing", "D. A government agency overseeing rail workers and their conditions"],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, founded by A. Philip Randolph in 1925, was the first successful Black labor union. Pullman porters worked grueling hours for low pay, dependent on tips, and faced constant racism from passengers.

A government policy regulating layoff procedures across all industries"],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The 'last hired, first fired' pattern meant Black workers were only hired during labor shortages and were always the first let go during economic downturns.

      "explanation": "Major unions including the AFL explicitly excluded Black workers or maintained segregated 'auxiliary' locals with no voting rights. Craft unions in construction, plumbing, and electrical work were particularly exclusionary, using apprenticeship requirements and nepotism to keep Black workers out.

      "explanation": "South Carolina's eight-box law (1882) required voters to place separate ballots for each office into the correct box. If a ballot was placed in the wrong box, it was invalidated. Election officials could change box positions at will.

      "options": ["A. That it successfully reduced drug addiction and crime rates nationwide", "B.

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In a 1994 interview published by Harper's Magazine in 2016, Ehrlichman confessed: 'We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.'

How the Republican Party rejected racial appeals after the Civil Rights Act", "D. How Democrats invented the Southern Strategy and Republicans opposed it"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In a 1981 interview, Atwater explained how racial appeals evolved: 'You start out in 1954 by saying n*****, n*****... By 1968 you can't say n*****—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights... You're getting so abstract now, you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.'",

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "D.W. Griffith's 'The Birth of a Nation' romanticized the Klan as heroes saving white civilization from Black 'savages.' President Woodrow Wilson screened it at the White House.

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Most Confederate monuments were not built to honor the dead immediately after the war. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, there were two major spikes: during the Jim Crow era (1900-1920) when Black people were being systematically disenfranchised, and during the Civil Rights movement (1950s-1960s).

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The United Daughters of the Confederacy waged a decades-long campaign to control textbook content in Southern schools.

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act created a 100:1 disparity: 5 grams of crack cocaine triggered the same 5-year mandatory minimum as 500 grams of powder cocaine. Since crack was more common in Black communities and powder in white communities, this resulted in wildly disproportionate incarceration. Black people are about 13% of crack users but 80% of those convicted. The disparity was reduced to 18:1 in 2010.",
