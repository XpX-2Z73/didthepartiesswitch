  "mission": "This site traces the unbroken line from Fort Sumter to the present day. We document who started the Civil War, why Reconstruction failed, how the Lost Cause rewrote history, and where the voters who opposed civil rights ended up. Every claim is linked to primary sources: secession declarations, speeches, strategy memos, and the words of the people who were there. Read them yourself.",
  "scope": "From the first shots at Fort Sumter (1861) through the party realignment (1948-1980s) to voting access battles today."
