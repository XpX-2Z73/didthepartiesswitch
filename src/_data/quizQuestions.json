      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Confederate forces opened fire on the federal garrison at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor at 4:30 AM on April 12, 1861. After 34 hours of bombardment, Major Robert Anderson surrendered. No one was killed in the battle itself, but it ignited the bloodiest war in American history.",

      "options": ["A. Tariff disputes with the North", "B. Slavery and its expansion", "C. Postal rates and services", "D. Gold vs silver currency debates"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Every seceding state issued a declaration explaining why they left. These documents mention slavery dozens of times and tariffs rarely or never. Mississippi's declaration begins: 'Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery.' They weren't hiding it.",
      "quote": "Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery—the greatest material interest of the world.",

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Confederate batteries under General P.G.T. Beauregard fired the first shots at 4:30 AM on April 12, 1861. The Union garrison under Major Anderson had not fired a shot. Edmund Ruffin, a pro-slavery advocate, claimed to have fired one of the first shots and later killed himself after the Confederacy lost.",

      "options": ["A. Mostly tariffs, slavery rarely", "B. Slavery throughout, tariffs never", "C. Equal mentions of both issues", "D. Neither topic is mentioned at all"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Mississippi's Declaration of Secession centers entirely on slavery and mentions tariffs zero times. The very second sentence identifies their position as 'thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery.' Georgia's declaration mentions slavery-related terms over 80 times. These aren't interpretations; they're documented word counts.",

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's Vice President, became the 17th President after Lincoln's assassination on April 15, 1865. Johnson, a Tennessee Democrat who had remained loyal to the Union, proved disastrous for Reconstruction. He pardoned Confederate leaders, opposed civil rights for freed slaves, and was impeached (though not removed) by Congress.",

      "question": "Why did the 'Lost Cause' mythology survive?",
      "options": ["A. It was historically accurate and supported by primary source documents from the era", "B. Andrew Johnson pardoned Confederate leaders who then rewrote history", "C. Lincoln endorsed it publicly before his assassination as a path to reconciliation", "D. It was taught only in Northern schools initially before spreading to the South"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Andrew Johnson pardoned over 13,000 Confederate officials instead of prosecuting them for treason. These men returned to power, founded organizations like the United Daughters of the Confederacy, placed monuments, and controlled textbooks for generations. The 'Lost Cause' (the lie that the war was about states' rights, not slavery) was invented by the very men who should have faced justice. Johnson's leniency let the losers write the history.",

      "options": ["A. First major civil rights march was organized there", "B. Armed coup overthrew the elected biracial government", "C. Lincoln gave a famous wartime speech there", "D. Fort Sumter was rebuilt after the Civil War"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 was the only successful coup d'état in American history. A white supremacist mob overthrew the legitimately elected biracial city government, murdered an estimated 60-300 Black residents, and drove thousands more from the city. For 113 years, textbooks called it a 'race riot caused by Black people.' The truth wasn't added to North Carolina's curriculum until 2011, when a state commission finally acknowledged what happened. The coverup lasted longer than the Confederacy existed.",

      "question": "Why did Strom Thurmond switch from Democrat to Republican in 1964?",
      "options": ["A. Tax policy disagreements with President Lyndon Johnson", "B. Opposition to Civil Rights Act", "C. Foreign policy disagreements over the Vietnam War", "D. He didn't actually switch parties at all"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Strom Thurmond switched parties on September 16, 1964, specifically because the Democratic Party had passed the Civil Rights Act. Thurmond had run for president in 1948 as a segregationist Dixiecrat. His switch to the GOP signaled that the party of Lincoln was now the home for those opposing civil rights.",
      "quote": "The Democratic Party has abandoned the people... It has repudiated the Constitution of the United States. It is leading the evolution of our nation to a socialistic dictatorship.",

      "options": ["A. Confederate military war plan to defend Southern territory from invasion", "B. GOP strategy using coded racial appeals to win white Southern voters", "C. Democratic political plan to win back the South after Reconstruction", "D. Federal Reconstruction policy for rebuilding Southern states after war"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Southern Strategy was a Republican electoral strategy to win white Southern voters by appealing to racism against African Americans. Nixon adviser Kevin Phillips outlined it in 1970. Lee Atwater later explained how it evolved from explicit racism to coded language. In 2005, RNC Chairman Ken Mehlman formally apologized for it.",
      "quote": "You start out in 1954 by saying, 'N----r, n----r, n----r.' By 1968 you can't say 'n----r'—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff.",

      "question": "What happened to Southern white voters between 1860 and today?",
      "options": ["A. They always voted Republican consistently throughout history", "B. They switched from Democratic to Republican", "C. They always voted Democratic consistently throughout history", "D. They stopped voting in large numbers after Reconstruction"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In 1860, the white South voted Democratic and remained solidly Democratic for nearly 100 years. The shift began in 1948 with the Dixiecrat revolt, accelerated after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and was complete by the 1980s. Today, the former Confederate states are the most reliably Republican region in the country.",
      "quote": "From now on, the Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don't need any more than that... The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans.",

    {
      "question": "How long did this shift take?",
      "options": ["A. It happened overnight in 1964 when Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act", "B. Decades, from 1948 through the 1980s", "C. It never happened according to historical records and voting data", "D. One week in 1972 after the Watergate scandal broke"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The party realignment was gradual. It began with Thurmond's 1948 Dixiecrat campaign, gained momentum when Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act in 1964, was exploited by Nixon's Southern Strategy in 1968, and was solidified by Reagan in 1980. By the 1990s, the transformation was complete. It wasn't a single event; it was a generation of political change.",
      "quote": "Some Republicans gave up on winning the African American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization. I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong.",

      "question": "What did the Supreme Court's Shelby County decision (2013) do?",
      "options": ["A. Strengthened voting rights protections for minorities significantly", "B. Gutted Voting Rights Act preclearance", "C. Banned voter ID laws as unconstitutional nationwide", "D. Required automatic voter registration in all states"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court struck down the formula used to determine which states needed federal approval before changing voting laws. Within hours of the decision, Texas announced a strict voter ID law. Within months, states across the former Confederacy enacted new voting restrictions. The decision effectively ended federal oversight of voting in states with histories of discrimination.",
      "quote": "Our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.",

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "On Easter Sunday 1873, white paramilitaries attacked Black militia defending the Grant Parish courthouse in Louisiana. After the Black defenders surrendered, 60-150 men were pulled from the group and executed. The Supreme Court case that followed, U.S. v. Cruikshank (1876), ruled the 14th Amendment didn't apply to private violence, effectively making it legal for the Klan to murder Black citizens.",
      "quote": "The half of them was killed after the surrender... They were shot down like dogs.",

      "options": ["A. Immediate pardons and full restoration of their rights", "B. Treason trials and land confiscation", "C. Cabinet positions in the new unified government", "D. Voting rights to be restored quickly after the war"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Thaddeus Stevens, the Radical Republican leader, demanded that Confederate leaders be tried for treason and their land confiscated and redistributed to freed people ('40 acres and a mule'). He was ignored. Andrew Johnson instead pardoned over 13,000 Confederate officials, who returned to power and spent the next century building Jim Crow.",
      "quote": "Strip a proud nobility of their bloated estates, reduce them to a level with plain republicans, send them forth to labor and teach their children to enter the workshops or handle the plow, and you will thus humble the proud traitors.",

      "options": ["A. Abraham Lincoln in a speech", "B. Edward Pollard in 1866", "C. Martin Luther King Jr. later", "D. Robert E. Lee in his memoirs"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Edward Pollard, a Confederate newspaper editor, published 'The Lost Cause: A New Southern History of the War of the Confederates' in 1866, just one year after the war ended. He literally invented the name and the framework. The myth that the war was about 'states' rights' was manufactured propaganda, and we know exactly who started it.",
      "quote": "The Confederates have gone out of this war... with the proud, secret, dangerous consciousness that they are THE BETTER MEN.",

      "options": ["A. They became permanent federal law protecting all freedmen across the South", "B. Andrew Johnson reversed them and returned land to slaveholders", "C. They were expanded nationwide to include all freedmen in every state", "D. They were never actually issued to anyone because Congress blocked them"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In January 1865, General Sherman's Special Field Order No. 15 granted 400,000 acres of confiscated Confederate land to freed people along the Atlantic coast. Freed families began farming this land immediately. But Andrew Johnson reversed the order after Lincoln's assassination, evicted the freed people, and returned the land to the former slaveholders. The racial wealth gap that began with this betrayal persists today.",
      "quote": "Each family shall have a plot of not more than forty acres of tillable ground.",

      "question": "What pattern connects 1861 to 2024?",
      "options": ["A. Nothing connects them - the regions have completely changed their political character and voting patterns since then", "B. Ten of the 11 states that seceded are among those with the most voting restrictions today", "C. The North became significantly more conservative than the South on most political issues after the civil rights era", "D. All 50 states followed the same political path from initial Confederate sympathy to eventually supporting civil rights"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The 11 states that seceded in 1861 are the same 11 states that opposed civil rights in 1964. Ten of those 11 flipped Republican via the Southern Strategy and enacted voting restrictions after Shelby County (2013). Virginia is the exception, having trended blue since 2008. But for the Deep South, this isn't coincidence; it's inheritance.",
